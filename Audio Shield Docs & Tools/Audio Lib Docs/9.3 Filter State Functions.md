AudioFilterStateVariableSummaryA State Variable (Chamberlin) Filter with 12 dB/octave roll-off, adjustable resonance, and optional signal control of corner frequency.Audio ConnectionsPort	PurposeIn 0	Signal to FilterIn 1	Frequency ControlOut 0	Low Pass OutputOut 1	Band Pass OutputOut 2	High Pass OutputFunctionsfrequency(freq);Set the filter's corner frequency. When a signal is connected to the control input, the filter will implement this frequency when the signal is zero.resonance(Q);Set the filter's resonance. Q ranges from 0.7 to 5.0. Resonance greater than 0.707 will amplify the signal near the corner frequency. You must attenuate the signal before input to this filter, to prevent clipping.octaveControl(octaves);Set how much (in octaves) the control signal can alter the filter's corner freqency. Range is 0 to 7 octaves. For example, when set to 2.5, a full scale positive signal (1.0) will shift the filter frequency up 2.5 octaves, and a full scale negative signal will shift it down 2.5 octaves.NotesWhen controlled by a signal, the equation for the filter frequency is:F = Fcenter * 2^(signal * octaves)If anyone knows how to do HTML equations, please help me improve this.....When operating with signal control of corner frequency, this object uses approximately 4% of the CPU time on Teensy 3.1.
