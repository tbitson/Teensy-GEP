More damping causes higher frequency echo to decay, creating a softer sound, similar to a large room filled with people or materials which absorb some sound as it travels between reflecting surfaces. Lower damping simulates a harsher reverberant field.ExamplesFile > Examples > Audio > Effects > Freeverb_StereoNotesFreeverb mono consumes about 18% of the CPU time on Teensy 3.6 and requires about 45K of RAM.Teensy 3.2 does not have enough RAM to run this effect while playing WAV file and implementing USB Serial.
