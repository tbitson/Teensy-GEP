AudioEffectFreeverbSummaryHigh quality Reverb effect, based on Freeverb by Jezar at Dreampoint.Audio ConnectionsPort	PurposeIn 0	InputOut 0	OutputFunctionsroomsize(amount);Sets the amount of reverberant echo or apparent room size, from 0 (smallest) to 1.0 (largest);damping(amount);Sets the damping factor, from 0 to 1.0. More damping causes higher frequency echo to decay, creating a softer sound, similar to a large room filled with people or materials which absorb some sound as it travels between reflecting surfaces. Lower damping simulates a harsher reverberant field.ExamplesFile > Examples > Audio > Effects > FreeverbNotesFreeverb mono consumes about 21% of the CPU time on Teensy 3.2 and requires about 22K of RAM.
