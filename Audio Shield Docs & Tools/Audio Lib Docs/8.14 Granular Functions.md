AudioEffectGranularSummaryClassic granular effect that uses a variable speed buffer to shift the pitch and freeze incoming audio.

Until memory is allocated with this function, no audio appears at the output.setSpeed(ratio);Configure the relative speed grains will be played. 1.0 plays the grains without any change. Less than 1.0 slows the sound, and greater than 1.0 speeds up. The allowed range is 0.125 to 8.0, for Â±3 octaves shift.beginFreeze(grainLength);Freeze the sound by sampling one grain, then repeated playing it. The grainLength is specified in milliseconds, up to the size allowed by the array from begin().beginPitchShift(grainLength);Pitch shift by continuously sampling grains and playing them at altered speed. The grainLength is specified in milliseconds, up to one third of the memory from begin();end();Stop granual processing. The input signal is passed to the output without any changes.
