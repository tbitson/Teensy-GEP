AudioEffectDelaySummaryDelay a signal. Up to 8 separate delay taps can be used.1 kHz burst, delayed 5.2 ms.Audio ConnectionsPort	PurposeIn 0	Signal InputOut 0	Delay Tap #1Out 1	Delay Tap #2Out 2	Delay Tap #3Out 3	Delay Tap #4Out 4	Delay Tap #5Out 5	Delay Tap #6Out 6	Delay Tap #7Out 7	Delay Tap #8Functionsdelay(channel, milliseconds);Set output channel (0 to 7) to delay the signals by milliseconds. See the table below for the maximum delay. The actual delay is rounded to the nearest sample. Each channel can be configured for any delay. There is no requirement to configure the "taps" in increasing delay order.disable(channel);Disable a channel. The output of this channel becomes silent. If this channel is the longest delay, memory usage is automatically reduced to accomodate only the remaining channels used.ExamplesFile > Examples > Audio > Effects > DelayNotesMemory for the delayed signal is take from the memory pool allocated by AudioMemory(). Each block allows about 2.9 milliseconds of delay, so AudioMemory should be increased to allow for the longest delay tap.Each board has a maximum possible delay.Board	MaximumTeensy 3.0	139.26 msTeensy 3.1	449.39 msTeensy 3.2	449.39 msTeensy 3.5	1671.19 msTeensy 3.6	2413.94 ms
