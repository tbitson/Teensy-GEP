AudioEffectMidSideSummaryConvert stereo signals to/from Mid-Side format. Mid-Side encoding can be used to increase stereo width, make the lower frequencies mono (to please your sub), or as the basis of audio compression.Audio ConnectionsPort	WhileEncoding	WhileDecodingIn 0	Left Input	Mid OutputIn 1	Right Input	Side OutputOut 0	Mid Input	Left OutputOut 1	Side Input	Right OutputFunctionsencode();Configure this object to encode from stereo to Mid-Side format.decode();Configure this object to decode from Mid-Side format back to stereo signals.ExamplesFile > Examples > Audio > Effects > Mid_SideNotesMany interesting stereo effects can be achieved by manipulating Mid-Side signals.Normally a pair of these objects are used, one to encode, then additional gain/attenuation or effects applied to the Mid-Side signals, and finally decoding back to stereo signalsTo prevent saturation, halving is done in the encoding, that is:Mid = (left+right)/2Side = (left-right)/2And to decode:Left = Mid+SideRight = Mid-Side
