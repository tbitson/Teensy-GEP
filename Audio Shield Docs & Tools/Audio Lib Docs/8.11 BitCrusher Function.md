AudioEffectBitcrusherSummaryReduce the samplerate and/or bitdepth of a source signal, resulting in a distorted sound.Audio ConnectionsPort	PurposeIn 0	Signal InputOut 0	Signal OutputFunctionsbits(xcrushBits);xcrushBits sets the bitdepth, from 1 to 16. A Value of 16 does not crush the bitdepth, and is effectively a passthru for this part of the function.sampleRate(xsampleRate);xsampleRate sets the frequency, from 1 to 44100Hz, however it works in integer steps so you will only really get a handful of results from the many samplerates you can pass. 44100 is passthru.set xbitDepth to 16 and xsampleRate to 44100 to pass audio through without any Bitcrush effect.ExamplesFile > Examples > Audio > Effects > BitcrusherNotesNeeds a lot of improvement. Options for anti-aliasing would be nice in the future, but for now, it's rough, it's dirty and it sounds a bit like Nine Inch Nails.AudioNoInterrupts() should be used when changing settings on multiple objects, so all changes always take effect at the same moment.
