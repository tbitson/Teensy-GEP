AudioEffectFadeSummaryGradually increase or decrease audio level.Audio ConnectionsPort	PurposeIn 0	Signal InputOut 0	Signal OutputFunctionsfadeIn(milliseconds);Begin increasing the audio level, to reach 1.0 (input passed directly to the output) after "milliseconds" time.fadeOut(milliseconds);Begin decreasing the audio level, to reach 0 (no output) after "milliseconds" time.NotesCross fading can be built with 2 fade objects fed into a mixer. When one fade object is off (fully faded out) and the other on (fully faded in), if both are started at the same moment for the same time duration, their signal gains always add to 1.0. This allows 2 fade objects to work together for a smooth transition between a pair of signals.AudioNoInterrupts() should be used when changing settings on multiple objects, so all changes always take effect at the same moment.
